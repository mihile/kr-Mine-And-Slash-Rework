Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.8.txt

v.5.8.0

Currencies Rework

 * All Currencies are now datapacks! They are separated into item requirement datapacks and item modification datapacks.
Every currency is now a list of requirements and modifications.

* Totally revamped the In-Game library gui!
Search bar, filter types, scrolling..

* Characters gui reworked! 
Added rename and delete character options

NOTE: Some items will probably break or lose some of their data this update, because I refactored some code to better prepare for next minecraft versions.
What will probably break: unique items, corruption tag, max uses.
I will probably stop the item data rework here and wait for next update to finish it.

- Datapack change: spells can now allow other spells to benefit from their support gems! This can be used to:
	* make summons use their basic spell attacks and those attacks will benefit from supp gems used on the summon spell
	* spells that cause procs to also allow the proc spells to benefit
- changed summons to now use their basic attack as the spell now that they benefit from supp gems without hardcoded workarounds
